# About Emily's Github

**Mārama** is a web app created as part of a final group project during studies at Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA). The team plan on continuing the development of Mārama and you can find more information on what the purpose is and the code behind it in the [Mārama repository](https://github.com/Marama-App/marama).

**MEDALS** is a [learning management system](https://github.com/enspiral-dev-academy/medals) being developed by EDA, which our cohort contributed to over a multi day project in feature teams. My team worked on a user profile for students that has information visible to employers.

Other repositories available on my github are small, in class exercises worked on during my time at EDA, exercises I've done to practice my skills and those labeled Sprint-# are from the Phase-0 (at home study) part of the EDA course.
Topics have been added to each repo for clarification also.

I am currently working on some personal projects, [event app](https://github.com/emilyparkes/event-app) and [event web](https://github.com/emilyparkes/event-web) to practice and learn new skills.
